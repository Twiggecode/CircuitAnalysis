# CircuitAnalysis

### Please note, as this was a university project, we were restricted with the libraries that we were allowed to use, resulting in some overcomplicated solutions for certain problems regarding the formatting of output files.

University Python project that analyses an input file that represents a cascade circuit, calculating output data and displaying the output data in an output file.

The main file is 'main.py'. The files 'circuitsort.py', 'prefixcalc', 'prefixcalcinv' and 'ABCDmatrixcalc' are functions that are implemented within 'main.py'.
The files 'test.net' and 'test.out' are examples of the input and output files respectively.

## Running the program

To run the program, download all of the .py files and the .net file into the same directory (there is no need to download the example output .out file into the directory because the program will create an output file).

Open 'main.py' with your IDE of choice, follow the instructions within 'main.py' to set the command line arguments needed to run the program. When the command line arguments are set, run 'main.py' and an output file will be generated in the same directory. Open the output file and look at the data generated. Try changing the input file and run 'main.py' again, generating a new output file.
